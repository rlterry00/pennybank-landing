        <p style={{ margin: 10 }}>
          Penny Bank is designed for families with children 13 or younger (old
          enough to use a device). Although there are plenty of uses cases we
          are working on future features that cater to teenagers.

      <AccordionItem title="Whatâ€™s the difference between Penny Bank and Penny Bank Plus">
        <p style={{ margin: 10 }}>
          Penny Bank was our flagship product considered to be a lite version of
          Penny Bank Plus. At the current moment, we have switched fully over to
          Penny Bank Plus. Penny Bank and Penny Bank Plus are both made by Team
          Penny Bank

      <AccordionItem title="Does it cost to have a Penny Bank account?">
        <p style={{ margin: 10 }}>
          I'm glad you asked. Penny Bank accounts are free. Signing up gives you
          access to a Penny Bank account which can be used to access the web app
          and with future products as well. Penny Bank Plus mobile app is free
          to download in the app stores. The only cost is a small membership fee
          to access Penny Bank Plus mobile app. The web app is for account
          services and is limited on features.
